# Mooblooms and Mud Mod

This is a Minecraft Mod for version 1.16.5. The mod contains the Moobloom, a mob that was proposed to the game during the 2020 MineCon, but didn't make the cut. There are three different color Mooblooms, pink, blue and yellow, which each leave a unique trail of flowers when they walk. The Moobloom spawns with other passive animals and when killed drops the same things as cows except with a chance of a dandelion as well.

Besides the Moobloom there is also Mud blocks indroduced, which spawn in disk formations in riverbeds and lakes (just like sand, gravel and dirt). Players can sink into the mud by hitting shift, which grants them the camoflauge potion effect while they are in the mud. This, like inivisiblity, hides the player frm hostile mobs and other players (as long as they are not wearing armor). Mud needs to be near water in order to remain as mud, otherwise it turns back into dirt.
